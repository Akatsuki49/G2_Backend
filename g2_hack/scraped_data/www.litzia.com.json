The tech made things easy for me to understand, and for someone who is a tech dummy (me), that speaks volumes. He understood that not everyone has the knowledge he does and was patient with my ignorance of what we were trying to accomplish. It was nice to work with someone in a IT dept. that gets that! I have not had this experience with others in IT (other companies, not yours). Thanks for the great service!. Dave Jorgenson, Field Service. As usual, James was on top of it and got the problem fixed in no time. I appreciate that he takes the time to answer my questions and clear up confusion.. Sandy Hanson, Retail. Technicians are very clear and explain procedures in a manner I understand. Prompt response time.. Karen Coleman, Government.
